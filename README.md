# Testing

  For testing, you should type in your test data line by line within the console, or, you can paste all your data at once. To calculate 
  the Name/Email/Phone Number, you must enter a blank space to signal that you are done entering data. For example, you can paste in
  
        Bob Smith

        ABC Technologies

  and you would just have to enter a blank line to extract the necessary data.

  and the program will stop running.
